	<h1>We make a supper quality logos</h1>

	<p>Mike Ground Tennis — A little color and a lot of white space go a long way. This ad is easy to read and the copy and imagery illustrate exactly what customers can expect from the company. You’ll also notice that the business logo is front and center, helping Mike Tennis build brand awareness.</p>

	<p>Stay Gold Delicatessen — Along with its simple, contrasting color scheme, this one has all the information you need (address, hours of operation, website address, phone number and special pricing). There is a clear call to action (“Check out our happy hours at both locations”) and the fonts are varied to emphasize important details.</p>
